Theory Used in Exercise 4

Arithmetic Operators
- Basic arithmetic operators used: +, -, *, /, %.
- Used for swapping values, digit extraction, expression evaluation, and numeric computation.
- % gives remainder (used for digits and divisibility checks).
- / removes last digit in integer digit-processing logic.

Bitwise Operators
- Operators used: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>.
- & is used for carry generation in bitwise addition and for power-of-2 checking logic.
- ^ is used to add bits without carry in bitwise addition.
- << is used to shift carry in bit-level addition.
- |, ^, ~, <<, >> are demonstrated on integer inputs for bit manipulation.

Relational and Logical Checks
- Relational operators (>, <, ==) are used in condition checks.
- Logical OR (||) is used in overflow boundary validation.
- Combined conditions are used for correctness checks (overflow and numeric properties).

Increment and Decrement Operators
- Post and pre forms are used: a++, ++a, a--, --a.
- Demonstrates evaluation-order difference between post and pre operations.

Assignment and Compound Expressions
- Assignment operator (=) stores computed values.
- Multi-operator expressions are evaluated using precedence and parentheses.
- Intermediate variable usage is applied to keep expressions readable.

Type Conversion and Casting
- Implicit conversion: int to double (widening conversion).
- Explicit conversion: double to int using cast (narrowing conversion).
- Explicit cast may truncate decimal part (precision loss).

Data Type Limits and Overflow Check
- Integer.MAX_VALUE and Integer.MIN_VALUE are used to check safe multiplication-by-2 range.
- Boundary comparison avoids overflow before performing multiplication.

Math Utility Functions
- Math.pow(base, exponent) is used for compound interest computation.
- Used with floating-point arithmetic for financial formula evaluation.

Input Handling
- Scanner is used for keyboard integer input in most exercise files.
- nextInt() reads numeric input values.
- Command-line arguments are also used via args[].
- Integer.parseInt(args[i]) converts argument text into integers.

Output Functions
- System.out.print() for inline output.
- System.out.println() for line-based output.
- System.err.println() also appears for console error stream demonstration.

Loops
- while loop for repeated checks and iterative processing.
- do-while loop for post-condition iteration.
- for loop for controlled counter-based iteration.
- Nested loops are used for 2D and 3D array traversal.
- Recursion is used to compute digit sum without loops.

Conditional Branching
- if-else is used for decisions like overflow, power-of-2, and prime check.
- switch-case is used for menu-style selection flow.
- break is used in loops and switch to stop control flow when required.

Arrays
- 2D arrays are declared and traversed using nested loops.
- 3D arrays are declared and traversed using triple nested loops.
- Index-based access is used to print matrix/cube elements.

OOP and Java-Specific Features
- Class and object creation is used to organize logic into methods.
- Method calls encapsulate operations such as add, swap, evaluate, and compute.
- Inheritance is demonstrated with subclass extending superclass.
- instanceof operator is used for runtime type relationship checking.

Number Property Logic
- Power-of-2 check uses bit rule: n & (n-1).
- Prime validation uses trial division loop and early exit with break.
- Digit-based logic uses repeated modulo and division operations.
