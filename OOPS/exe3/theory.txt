Theory Used in Exercise 3

BufferedReader and InputStreamReader
- InputStreamReader(System.in) converts keyboard byte input into character stream.
- BufferedReader wraps InputStreamReader for efficient text input.
- read() reads a single character and returns its integer code.
- readLine() reads an entire line as String.
- Integer.parseInt() is used with readLine() to convert text into int.
- While mixing read() and readLine(), newline handling is important to avoid skipped input.

Scanner
- Scanner (java.util.Scanner) is used for typed keyboard input.
- nextInt() reads integers.
- nextDouble() reads floating-point values.
- nextLine() reads full string lines.
- Suitable for reading multiple values in sequence.

System.out Output Functions
- System.out.print() prints without newline.
- System.out.println() prints with newline.
- System.out.printf() prints formatted output.
- Common format specifiers used:
  %d for int, %.2f for decimal precision, %c for char, %b for boolean.

String Methods Used
- length() gets string length.
- charAt(index) accesses characters.
- equals() compares two strings.
- These are used in logic like palindrome checking.

Loops
- for loop is used for repeated input, average calculation, pattern printing, and multiplication table generation.

Conditional Statements
- if-else is used for decisions like even/odd, largest value, and palindrome status.

Type Casting and Conversions
- (char) and (int) casting is used to convert between character and numeric code values.
- parse methods are used to convert string input to numeric data types.

Math Utility
- Math.PI is used in circle calculations (area and circumference).

Command-line Arguments
- args[] in main(String args[]) is used to accept values passed during program execution.

Packages
- package keyword groups related classes into a namespace.
- Helps in code organization and avoids class name conflicts.
- If a file declares a package, compile and run using matching folder structure.
