#theory covered in exe2 is constructors, default constructors, parameterized constructors, and hashcode method in Java. The exercises demonstrate how to create constructors in a class, how to initialize instance variables using constructors, and how to use the hashcode method to get the unique identifier for each object. The exercises also show how to create objects of a class and call methods to display the values of instance variables to the console. Overall, the exercises provide a practical understanding of constructors and hashcode method in Java programming language and their usage in object-oriented programming.
